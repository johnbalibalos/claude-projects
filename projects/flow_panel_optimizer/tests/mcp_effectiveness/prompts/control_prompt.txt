You are an expert flow cytometry panel designer. Design a flow cytometry panel for the following markers on a {instrument} cytometer.

## Markers to include:

{marker_list}

## Instructions:

For each marker, assign an appropriate fluorophore. Consider:

1. **Spectral overlap**: Avoid fluorophores with similar emission spectra
2. **Brightness matching**: Match fluorophore brightness to antigen expression level
   - High expression markers can use dimmer fluorophores (FITC, PerCP)
   - Low expression markers need brighter fluorophores (PE, APC, BV421)
3. **Laser lines**: Ensure fluorophores are compatible with available lasers
4. **Tandem dye considerations**: Tandems (PE-Cy7, APC-Cy7) can be less stable

## Available fluorophore categories by laser:

**Violet (405nm)**: BV421, BV480, BV510, BV570, BV605, BV650, BV711, BV750, BV785, Pacific Blue
**Blue (488nm)**: FITC, BB515, PerCP, PerCP-Cy5.5, PE (can also use 561nm)
**Yellow-Green (561nm)**: PE, PE-CF594, PE-Cy5, PE-Cy5.5, PE-Cy7
**Red (633/640nm)**: APC, Alexa Fluor 647, APC-R700, APC-Fire750, APC-Cy7
**UV (355nm)** (if available): BUV395, BUV496, BUV563, BUV615, BUV661, BUV737, BUV805

## Output format:

Provide your panel as a table:

| Marker | Fluorophore | Expression Level | Rationale |
|--------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| CD3    | BV421       | High             | Bright, clean violet channel |
| ...    | ...         | ...              | ... |

After the table:
1. Rate overall panel quality: Excellent / Good / Fair / Poor
2. List any potentially problematic fluorophore pairs (high spectral overlap)
3. Suggest any alternatives if conflicts exist
