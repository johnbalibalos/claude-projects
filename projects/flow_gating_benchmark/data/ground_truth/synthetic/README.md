# Synthetic Test Cases

Auto-generated test cases with synthetic panel and gating hierarchy data.

**Important**: The panel entries and gating hierarchies in these files do NOT match
the actual content of the referenced OMIP papers. These are placeholder/synthetic
data structures used for development and testing.

## Use Cases
- Testing benchmark infrastructure
- Validating JSON schema compliance
- Development of scoring algorithms

## Real DOIs
The DOI fields have been updated to reference actual OMIP publications,
but the panel/gating content is fabricated.
