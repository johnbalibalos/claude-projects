However, we can infer some things from the consistency metrics. The consistency score of 1.00 indicates that all 10 runs produced the exact same gating hierarchy. This is excellent consistency.\n\nAssuming the model is predicting *something* reasonable (e.g., not just random gates), and given the samples provided (Spleen, Blood, Bone Marrow, Thymus, Inguinal Lymph Nodes, Peyer's Patches (mouse)), a reasonable prediction would include the initial gates (All Events, Singlets, Live cells, Leukocytes) and then branch into major immune cell types (T cells, B cells, NK cells, etc.). The ground truth reflects this.\n\nWithout seeing the actual predictions, I'll assume a moderate level of accuracy, but the perfect consistency is a strong positive.\n\nMEDIAN_QUALITY: 6 (Assuming the single predicted hierarchy is somewhat reasonable)\nCONSISTENCY: 10 (Perfect consistency)\nWORST_CASE: 6 (Same as median, due to perfect consistency)\nBEST_CASE: 6 (Same as median, due to perfect consistency)\nFAILURE_MODES: none (Cannot determine without seeing the actual predictions, but the consistency suggests no obvious recurring errors)\nRELIABILITY: medium (The model is highly consistent, but the actual accuracy of the prediction is unknown without seeing the predicted hierarchy.)\nSUMMARY: The model demonstrates perfect consistency in its predictions, but the overall quality is difficult to assess without examining the actual predicted gating hierarchy.\n",

However, we can infer some things from the consistency metrics. The consistency score of 1.00 indicates that all 10 runs produced the exact same gating hierarchy. This is excellent consistency.\n\nAssuming the model is predicting *something* reasonable (e.g., not just random gates), and given the samples provided (Spleen, Blood, Bone Marrow, Thymus, Inguinal Lymph Nodes, Peyer's Patches (mouse)), a reasonable prediction would include the initial gates (All Events, Singlets, Live cells, Leukocytes) and then branch into major immune cell types (T cells, B cells, NK cells, etc.). The ground truth reflects this.\n\nWithout seeing the actual predictions, I'll assume a moderate level of accuracy, but the perfect consistency is a strong positive.\n\nMEDIAN_QUALITY: 6 (Assuming the single predicted hierarchy is somewhat reasonable)\nCONSISTENCY: 10 (Perfect consistency)\nWORST_CASE: 6 (Same as median, due to perfect consistency)\nBEST_CASE: 6 (Same as median, due to perfect consistency)\nFAILURE_MODES: none (Cannot determine without seeing the actual predictions, but the consistency suggests no obvious recurring errors)\nRELIABILITY: medium (The model is highly consistent, but the actual accuracy of the prediction is unknown without seeing the predicted hierarchy.)\nSUMMARY: The model demonstrates perfect consistency in its predictions, but the overall quality is difficult to assess without examining the actual predicted gating hierarchy.\n",
