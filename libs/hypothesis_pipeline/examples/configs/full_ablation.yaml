# Full Ablation Study
# Tests all combinations of dimensions
# WARNING: This can generate many conditions (n^4 or more)

name: full_ablation
description: Comprehensive ablation across all dimensions
hypothesis: Testing interaction effects between reasoning, context, RAG, and tools

# This config generates:
# 1 model × 3 reasoning × 3 context × 2 rag × 1 tools = 18 conditions
# With tools: 1 × 3 × 3 × 2 × 2 = 36 conditions
